## Project Objectives

- Design a scalable and secure network for a bank branch.
- Implement subnetting and VLAN segmentation.
- Configure inter-VLAN routing using Router-on-a-Stick.
- Enable OSPF for dynamic routing between routers.
- Secure access with SSHv2 and port security.
- Ensure end devices can communicate across VLANs and remote offices.

## Network Structure

- **Subnetting**: 172.16.10.0/24 divided into 8 subnets using /27 mask.
- **VLANs**:
  - VLAN 10 – Management (CEO)
  - VLAN 20 – Marketing (Copyrighters)
  - VLAN 30 – Accounting (Dialers)
  - VLAN 100 – Native VLAN for trunk links
- **Router-on-a-Stick**:
  - Sub-interfaces configured on R1 to route between VLANs.
- **Dynamic Routing**:
  - OSPF is configured between R1, R2, and R3.
- **Security**:
  - SSHv2 enabled on R3 and S1-Office3.
  - Port security enabled on all access ports.
